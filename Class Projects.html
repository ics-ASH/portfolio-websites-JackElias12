    <h2 id=text> ORANGE Guitar Amp</h2>
    <iframe id=projects
   src="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/lavenderBlushAlligator4666/embed"> 
 </iframe>
  <p > This was the first project I made in CMU from the information I learned in Unit 1. I spend at lot of time getting the points right and identical on the knobs and getting the right colors for the amp as ORANGE is a real guitar brand. I wanted to keep it simple while implying all the techniques I learned and I think it turned out wuite well. Looking back on it, it would have been very easy to make the knobs move and have sound come out of the amps that change with the knobs.</p>

    <h2 id=text> Volcano Eruption</h2>

 </iframe>
  <p>This was the secound project I made in CMU based on what I learned in Unit 2. It is a volcano that erupts with the movement of the slider at the bottom, which also changes the time of day. I wanted to make more details like a meteor in the background, and maybe animals in the front such as dinosaurs, but I ran out of time. In the end, I'm satisfied with how it turned out, as I learned a lot of interesting ways to figure out problems regarding things changing with the movement of the slider, along with how to draw complicated shapes using polygons.</p>

    <h2 id=text> K8 Advertisement - Collaborative Task</h2>
    <iframe id=projects

 </iframe>
 <p> This was a quick project I did with my group, Horacio, Izzy and Sanjay for our K8 project. We took inspiration from the game brawl stars like you are unlocking a new brawler. Search up, 'Brawl Stars' new brawler legendary' and you will see how close the details in our advertisement were to the real deal. If you click anywhere on the screen our robot appears with moving eyes.</p>
