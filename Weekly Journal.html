    <td> <p> This week we finally ended up playing Minecraft also known as MCU. We built a house and played some more creative. I learned that I should bring a charger for my computer because it died three times in a row this week.</p> </td>
    <td> <p> This week we learned all about binary numbers. How to add, subtract and read them. We had a quiz on binary numbers. I learned how to read  them and understand them as I was always confused on how and why people picked 1s and 0s to be computer languages. It all makes sense now as it is like on and off switches that can be read in a series to determine messages.</p></td>

    <td><p> This week, we learned about the internet and how to code in HTML. It is a very useful language to create websites and formatting purposes. It will be used to create this website and probably other projects in the future concerning websites and more. I want to learn more about CSS as I believe from the tutorials that it will make the website look better than just HTML.</p></td>
    <td><p> We did a program called Belouga this week. We learned and answered questions about the internet and AI. Additionally, making a presentation on AI. I learned all about how it applies to real life scenarios, and how it can be incorporated and used behind the scenes of every day applications.</p></td>

    <td><p>This week we started our unit 1 CS CMU academy final task. The unit consisted only of how to create scenes and drawing shapes. I made mine a ORANGE guitar amp as I play guitar. I learned how to make smaller shapes and precise details in CMU. It took a long time but I like how it turned out. </p></td>
    <td><p> This week we worked more on CMU. Getting through both Unit 1 and 2. I learned a lot about functions and events. It helped me come up with an idea for the next unit task. </p></td>

    <td><p> This week we worked on CMU CS academy unit 2. Our final projects are coming to end. Mine is a volcano that you can erupt by dragging a slider. It took a long time to get the background to change with the slider and making the scenery using ovals and irregular polygons. I learned a lot about creating code in CMU more specifically how to drwa bushes, palm trees, etc.</p></td>
    <td><p> This week we started our hardware unit. We worked on deconstructing a desktop computer and then proceeded to start on hardware projects. I learned about all the different parts of a computer along with the tedious work required to build them. </p></td>

    <td><p> This week we finished up our hardware projects after working on them for the past month. The project consisted of building our own computer based on a profession. I chose to be gamer and make myself a supercomputer. My final budget was around $10 000. I've learned that if I want to make my dream computer I will have to work a job year round to start saving up money. </p></td>
    <td><p>This week we kept working on our hardware posters and build your own computer projects. I was already finished so I worked on an additional game for CMU on unit 3. I started testing an idea for a hunter style game like in the arcades with the guns. I learned how to make a timer and make the concept and fundamentals of that game.</p></td>

    <td><p>This week we started working on K8. K8 is a robot that we built that week and uses microbits to operate. The microbits can be programmed on the computer then downloaded onto physical bits. I learned about how to program and use a microbit and getting used to using K8. </p></td>
    <td><p>This week we continued to work K8 with our groups. We drew our wall and prepared for the K8 showdown next week. We gave our K8 a pencil and drew some papers to tape to our robot which we named Cordelius. I learned how to drive the robot and make it go in all directions.</p></td>

    <td><p>This week we cleaned up our websites and did our K8 battle. I learned that maybe we should have used the servos motor during the battle as our pin kept falling off during the battles. The website also got a background added which make it look a lot better. </p></td>
    <td><p> This week we started relearning about AI in CodeHS. We learned all about how AI is trained and created, from the jobs used, to the process overseas of how it differs between humans and their surroundings. We played a lot of Google Games that used AI and I thought some of them were pretty fun, especially the music one. Where you can generate an audio file of an instrument you chose.</p></td>
