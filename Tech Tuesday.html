                 <i>What is a Motherboard?</i>
                 <p>The motherboard is the largest circuit board that can be found in any computer. It is the central component that distributes electrical power to all the other parts of the computer such as the RAM, CPU and GPU. They hold all the inputs for hardware inside and outside of the case such as the keyboard and mouse. Motherboards are made in all different styles and sizes that vary depending on the chassis and other components that anyone would want in their system. The other components of a computer must be compatible with the motherboard in order for them to function properly. For example, motherboards of a certain brand and also generations (the latest to oldest version)  will not be as versatile as a hard drive. They are typically the first part of a computer you buy when building a computer from scratch.</p>

They were very successful with that which led other companies to follow even though it was a risky move. Eventually , Intel had a dominant share of the personal motherboard. Asus, Gigabyte Technology  and Micro Star International became the three most influential companies in this industry.  </p>
